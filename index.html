					<p>Welcome to my Pig Game! This is a two playere game. The goal is getting to 50 overall points before your opponent. Player 1 starts the game. They roll the dice and the number they roll is their current score. If the current player rolls a 1 then it is the next players turn. If not, then the current player can keep rolling the dice. Whenever the current player feels good about their current score they can hit hold button and those points transition to their overall score, and then it is the next players turn. First player with 50 overall points wins!</p>
